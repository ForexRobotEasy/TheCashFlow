## Code Description
The code is written in MQL4 language and consists of the following sections:

### Include necessary libraries
The code includes the Trade library, which provides functions for executing trades.

### Define constants
The code defines the following constants:
- `SYMBOL`: The symbol to trade (e.g., 'EURUSD').
- `STOP_LEVEL`: The stop level in pips.
- `TRAILING_STOP`: The trailing stop level in pips.

### Define global variables
The code declares a global variable `trade` of type `CTrade`, which is used to execute trades.

### Function to identify breakouts
The `identifyBreakout()` function compares the current high and low prices with the previous high and low prices to determine if a breakout has occurred. It returns a boolean value indicating whether a breakout has been identified.

### Function to execute trades based on breakout strategy
The `executeTrades()` function calls the `identifyBreakout()` function and if a breakout is identified, it calculates the stop loss and take profit levels based on the previous high and low prices. It then executes buy and sell stop orders using the `BuyStop()` and `SellStop()` functions of the `trade` object.

### Function to adjust trailing stop
The `adjustTrailingStop()` function calculates the current order's profit using the `Profit()` function of the `trade` object. If the profit is equal to or greater than the trailing stop level, it modifies the trailing stop using the `ModifyTrailingStop()` function.

### Function to manage risk
The `manageRisk()` function retrieves the current account balance and equity using the `AccountInfoDouble()` function. If the account equity is less than 50% of the account balance, it closes all open trades using the `CloseAll()` function of the `trade` object.

### Initialization function
The `OnInit()` function is called during the EA initialization. It sets the expert magic number for the `trade` object.

### Start function
The `OnTick()` function is called on each tick of the market. It calls the `executeTrades()`, `adjustTrailingStop()`, and `manageRisk()` functions.

### Deinitialization function
The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the EA is removed from the chart or during terminal shutdown. It closes all open trades using the `CloseAll()` function of the `trade` object.
